## 📋 Problem Description

It's often necessary to assign a unique identifier to each row in a table. Rather than manually assigning a unique value to each row, PostgreSQL provides a way to automatically generate one for each row by auto incrementing.

There are a few different ways to do this in PostgreSQL: SERIAL: This is a shorthand for creating an auto-incrementing integer column.

IDENTITY: Introduced in PostgreSQL 10, this is the SQL standard way to create auto-incrementing columns.

SEQUENCES: You can define your own sequence, and set the start value and increment value. Notice that we only inserted values into the id_0 column. The other columns were automatically populated similar to DEFAULT values.

The following are the results of the above query: id_0

id_1

id_2

id_3 1

1

1

10 2

2

2

20 3

3

3

30 SERIAL is the most common method for creating auto-incrementing columns in PostgreSQL but may not be supported in other SQL databases.

IDENTITY is the SQL standard way to create auto-incrementing columns. GENERATED ALWAYS AS means that the column is automatically generated based on the sequence and does not allow explicit insertion, unlike SERIAL.

A SEQUENCE can be shared by multiple tables, which means that both tables will have a unique sequence of integers. For example, table-a may have 10, 30, 50 and table-b may have 20, 40, 60. They won't have any overlap. To read more about the differences between SERIAL and IDENTITY see here.

ChallengeCreate a sequence called gov_id that starts at 1000 and increments by 3.

Create a table called gov_employee with the following columns: id of type INTEGER that uses the IDENTITY keyword to auto increment, and does not allow explicit insertion. It should also be the primary key of the table.

gov_id of type INTEGER where the DEFAULT value is the next value from the gov_id sequence.

name of type TEXT.
