## 📋 Problem Description

The INSERT statement is used to insert one or more new rows into a table.

After the INSERT INTO statement, we specify the name of the table, followed by a comma-separated list of columns to insert into. The order of the columns must match the order of the values in the VALUES clause.

We could have reordered the columns by placing the id column at the end, for example:

This is equivalent to the first example. The resulting table will still be the same: id

name

status 1

Alice

active 2

Bob

inactive 3

Charlie
