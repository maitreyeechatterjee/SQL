## 📋 Problem Description

A primary key is a special column within a table. It must be unique for each row and cannot contain a NULL value. In addition, there can only be one primary key in a table.

In general, it's a good practice to have a primary key in every table. It helps to uniquely identify each row and can be used to establish relationships between tables. We usually use an id column as the primary key.

ChallengeCreate a table called users with the following columns: id of type INTEGER as the primary key

username of type TEXT Create a table called videos with the following columns: id of type INTEGER as the primary key

title of type TEXT

owner_id of type INTEGER What's the difference between a Primary Key & combining the NOT NULL and UNIQUE constraints? A primary key is a column or a group of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. It is a combination of the NOT NULL and UNIQUE constraints, but with additional properties. There can only be one primary key in a table. Primary keys can also be made up of multiple columns, known as a composite key. Databases also create an index on the primary key column(s) to speed up queries.
